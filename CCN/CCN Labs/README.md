## Simple Description
Most of the codes here are in C or C++ as required by the course. But I have also implemented some in python. Had a lot of fun in this course!
### List of programs contained in this repo
1. Write a program to demonstrate framing. (BitStuff.c and ByteStuff.c and Stuffing.py)
2. Write a program to generate CRC code for checking errors. (CRC.cpp)
3. Write a program to simulate Shortest Path Routing Algorithm. (Dij.cpp and DijkstraAlgo.cpp)
4. Study the Basic Networking Commands. (BasicNetworking.c)
5. Write a program to encrypt and decrypt a given message using substitution cipher method. (CaesarCipher.cpp and SubCipher.py)
6. Write a program to implement Diffie-Hellman Algorithm. (DiffieHellman.cpp)
