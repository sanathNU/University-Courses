# Computer Communication Networks
This was a pretty awesome course. I undertook this in my 6th Semester. <br>Learnt a lot about basic computing networks and many algorithms.
Mostly, this helped me learn a lot of network security topics! I even wrote a report on Tor Networking which can be found in the AAT folder. <br>
Please mind the mistakesðŸ˜…, it's just the work of an overstressed undergrad student. <br>
