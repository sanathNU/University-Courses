# Microcontrollers
The was a pretty nice course, it helped me learn more about computer architecture and how the internals work. <br>
Had a lot of fun with the hardware programming of the 8051 microcontroller board. <br>
### Codes for exps
The code for the following topics are not organized, but these are the topics it contains: <br>
<ol>
<li> Assembly Language Programs to <br>
  <ul>
   <li>Data Transfer Operations 
  <li> Arithmetic, Logical Operations 
  <li> Conditional and Bit Manipulation Operation
  <li> Port Functioning and Delay operations
  </ul>
<li> Embedded C programs for Arithemetic, Logical and Port Operations on simulator. 
<li> Harware interfacing programs such as Stepper Motor, KeyBoard, ADC and ADC, Serial Communication.
</ol>

Also contains an Half unfinished code of 32 bit Adder. Tried to make it work. Gave up after a while😅.
Everything was run in hardware 8051 Kit and software Keil Uvision 5.
